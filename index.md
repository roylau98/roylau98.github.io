My name is Roy, a year 3 university undergraduate pursuing a computer science degree. My interest lies in 3 main areas, computer security, artificial intelligence (AI) and competitive programming. I am looking to work in the cybersecurity field once I graduate, and I am most interested in a penetration testing job.

My interest in cybersecurity started during my first Capture The Flag (CTF) competition. Even though I did poorly in it, I was introduced to computer security there, and this interest would continue to grow as I participated in more CTFs. In my free time, I would still attend CTFs to hone my skills and learn more about computer security.

Programming languages learnt: C, C++, Python, Java
