I'm Roy, a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, specifically in blue team operations. I am also interested in the field of artificial intelligence and competitive programming. 

As an avid learner, I constantly seek new avenues to enhance my skills. I've delved into courses and earned certifications, most recently Blue Team Level 1. Additionally, I actively participate in Capture The Flag challenges to hone my abilities and skills.

I have always been interested in cybersecurity as it is a challenging and complex field. Attackers are constantly deploying and developing new tatics/ techniques, and defenders must stay vigilant against this evolving landscape. Thus, each day can be very different, and I will be constantly challenged and be able to learn new things. I derive fulfilment from defending against threats and be able to detect, prevent and mitigate attacks and thwart potential attackers.  

Programming languages learnt: C, C++, Python, Java
